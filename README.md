# AoE2DE-Auto-predictions-Streamer.bot
Setup, walkthrough. and code to use Streamer.bot to automatically generate channel predictions using responses from SpectatorDashboard

[Grathwrang](https://www.twitch.tv/grathwrang "Grathwrang") had the idea and was working to get this setup, and I hopped in to offer programming skills and assistance.

This is the result of that, and should now offer a working tool for the AoE2DE community to use as they please.

## Use

If you just want to import the actions and commands and get it working, see [quickstart](/quickuse.md)

See [walkthrough](/walkthrough) for a complete step-by-step breakdown of how it all works, and if you need to make any adjustments for your setup.
